# Logback benchmarking project

This mini project benchmarks logback against other logging frameworks
such as log4j 1 and log4j 2.

# Publicly verifiable results

Results are viweable as a [**Google doc spreadsheet**.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cpb5D7qnyye4W0RTlHUnXedYK98catNZytYIu5D91m0/edit?usp=sharing)

We feel that results provided by neutral parties, that is by
developers not directly affiliated with the logback project, lends
more credibility to our benchmarking results.

In the this spirit of result verifiability, we encourage *everyone* to
run the `runFileAppenderBenchmak.sh` script and post their results on
the [logback mailing lists](https://logback.qos.ch/mailinglist.html).
